    Returns a document snapshot, including the full DOM tree of the root node (including iframes,
    template contents, and imported documents) in a flattened array, as well as layout and
    white-listed computed style information for the nodes. Shadow DOM in the returned DOM tree is
    flattened.

    :param computed_styles: Whitelist of computed styles to return.
    :param include_paint_order: *(Optional)* Whether to include layout object paint orders into the snapshot.
    :param include_dom_rects: *(Optional)* Whether to include DOM rectangles (offsetRects, clientRects, scrollRects) into the snapshot
    :param include_blended_background_colors: **(EXPERIMENTAL)** *(Optional)* Whether to include blended background colors in the snapshot (default: false). Blended background color is achieved by blending background colors of all elements that overlap with the current element.
    :param include_text_color_opacities: **(EXPERIMENTAL)** *(Optional)* Whether to include text color opacity in the snapshot (default: false). An element might have the opacity property set that affects the text color of the element. The final text color opacity is computed based on the opacity of all overlapping elements.
    :returns: A tuple with the following items:

        0. **documents** - The nodes in the DOM tree. The DOMNode at index 0 corresponds to the root document.
        1. **strings** - Shared string table that all string properties refer to with indexes.
